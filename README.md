Understanding and analysis of the underlying mechanism of stock price was always one of the major 
objectives among traders and hedge-funds companies. The non-constant volatility of the stock returns 
demands for special models to predict the stock price characteristics. In this report, we analyse the 
underlying price evolution of the S&P 500 index and forecast the volatility and the return. In particular, 
we discuss the performance of a special model called Generalized AutoRegressive Conditional 
Heteroskedasticity (GARCH).
